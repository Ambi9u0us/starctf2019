This challenge is about differential cryptanalysis for FEAL-4 cipher. You can find a good tutorial at <http://theamazingking.com/crypto-feal.php>. But the FEAL-4 implementation here is non-standard so you need to understand the process of cryptanalysis and modify the differential path accordingly. Refer to [solve.py](https://github.com/sixstars/starctf2019/blob/master/crypto-notfeal/solve.py) for more details.

(I draw a picture of the path to help myself understand. But it looks ugly and I don't want to upload it lol)
